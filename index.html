    This is a website functions as a page one can play rock 
    paper scissors. The user picks their choice, the computer
    randomly picks their choice, and we compare the two choice
    to output the results. There is a record section that tracks
    the total number of wins, loses, and draws the user has
    until the user decides to reset their record.
